The Coin Flip Problem: Twirling a Noisy Coin
<br>

We simulated the coin protocol for detecting whether a coin is fair or not. We also simulated amplitude damping noise in this circuit. Then, we tested various methods of approximating error correction, including random twirling and Pauli conjugation.<br>
